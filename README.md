# Java Varargs Examples

This repository contains practice programs on **Java Varargs (Variable Arguments)**.  
I created these examples to understand how varargs work in different scenarios like:
- Passing single and multiple arguments
- Varargs with primitive types
- Varargs with objects
- Varargs with multi-dimensional arrays
- Ambiguity cases with overloading
-
